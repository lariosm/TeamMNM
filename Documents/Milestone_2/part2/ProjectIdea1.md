What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps?

Unlike other websites, it will feature items on the landing page based on location. Search results will, by default, be sorted by relevance and proximity. On that same note, individual listings will be prioritized over business listings. It will also implement a feedback system where users can leave a rating, along with optional comments about their transaction.

Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

This website would tailor to individuals over businesses, aiming to create a user-to-user experience with little paperwork.

What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need?

Additional APIâ€™s, such as PayPal to process transactions and perhaps more to come.

What algorithmic content is there in the project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea?

We will have to program the suggestions which will recommend similar items based on the keywords typed in their search.

Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

Given the number of features (and the algorithmic content) we'll need to implement as well as how the API's will interact with them will probably make it significantly difficult. For those reasons, we gave it a rating of 6.
