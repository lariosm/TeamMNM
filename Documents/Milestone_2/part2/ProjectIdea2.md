## Project Description

This project is a platform for people who are looking to get from one location to another, primary for music events, using public transportation. It will have access public transportation schedules so a person can find the best combination of buses, trains, or other forms of local public transit to get to their destination.


## What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps?

From what I can find so far there are no other websites dedicated to public transportation, however there is a similar feature that is limited within google maps. A related website/app would be google maps.


## Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?

This idea is worth doing because it would be one location that houses not only regular public transportation information, but limited information such as shuttles that may only be available during a given event. This project is not boring because there is a large portion of the population that may not have the financial ability to fly to their destination or even get a taxi or uber, this project will create an organized and inexpensive alternative.


## What resources will be required for you to complete this project?

The main resource need would be google's transit api, this will make available the public transport schedules needed.


## What algorithmic content is there in this project?

I believe we would need like a shortest path algorithm that will provide the shortest trip between point A and point B. In addition to that we will need to make sure that we can find either the fewest legs of a trip in order to provide the cheapest trip or possibly more legs of a trip that could added up to a cheaper trip.

The forms of transportation are available already, but the algorithms will be difficult to create.
