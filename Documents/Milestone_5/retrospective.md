# Class Project Retrospective

1. **Recite the prime directive of retrospectives.**
    > "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand." --Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review

2. **Conduct a safety check.**

Our team falls between #4 and #5. Even though we consider #4, our group is still very open, comfortable and willing to take communication of any sort.

3. **What did you learn from the sprint?**

As a group, we learned how to implement individual user accounts, we worked out repository and git issues, we got a better understanding of Azure DevOps, we learned how to effectively plan a sprint, and most importantly, we learned how to time manage as a group.

4. **What can the team do better during the next sprint? Make a specific Action Plan.**

We will add more technical detail into our user story descriptions, which will help us view an end goal for each user story.

5. **Are there any items that need to be brought up with someone outside the team? (i.e. in this case the instructor)**

Not really, but our group could use help with technical issues we come across with git and ASP.NET.
