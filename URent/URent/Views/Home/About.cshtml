    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h4>Vision Statement</h4>
    <p>
        For people who like to make a little money on the side or rent rather than purchase, this sharing economy rental website is a host for all of these kinds of peer to peer transactions. This rental website will be clean looking, easy to find local items that you are interested in, and even create a competitive market for affordable transactions. Unlike other rental websites, our website will have distinguished features that are extremely user friendly making it an enjoyable experience rather than a stressful one.

        People like to save money; people like to make money. People like to rent items instead of buying them, or rent their property out to make a little extra money. The problem with this is that there are not any good places to do this on the Web. Not only have businesses taken over the rental marketplace, but it is also very flawed.

        By flooding rental websites or mobile apps with business products, it deprecates the idea of a sharing economy. Some of these businesses include Rent-A-Center and Aaron's. A sharing economy and peer to peer transactions are main priorities for this web application. This is because by taking away the businesses, we can sustain a host that will give users, both owners and renters, a more personal and enjoyable renting experience.

        We have investigated other attempts at a rental website, and they are poor attempts. Just look at services like lendr and BeOmni which are mobile apps, and Zilok and PeerRenters are poorly designed websites. These services are not quite as simple as an Amazon or Craigslist when it comes to renting.

        We want a site that is simple, easy to use, and sharing economy friendly for people to find what they want or need to rent. Visitors should be able to search and view rentable products without having to log in, users should be able to make an account to both rent and rent out items, and it should be done easily. It should provide features for the user to sign in using a 3rd-party log in, manage their account, view their renting history, and even rate their rental experience.
